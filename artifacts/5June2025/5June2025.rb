# So the story is a story of a way, not a place. And like I was saying before you started recording, it's because what I've learned about human beings is that we're very place oriented, but within all of us is this way. And so I'm going to ask you all to imagine a couple of things and just remind you that you have consent. And what I mean by that is, I'm going to ask you imagine or remember a couple of things that might be difficult for you. The thing that I'm going to agree to is I'm not going to ask you for any details about those things. So essentially, I'm asking you is to hold space for whatever space is inside of you that is actively remembering those things, and trust that if you do something will happen for you that I don't have anything to do with. I don't need to know the content. Okay? And then I'm also gonna ask you to imagine some things that may be like, overly joyous, and you might feel compelled to share it. And I'm gonna ask you, in this moment to consider that you don't need to share it for it to be available. You could just be it. So imagine that there was this place that was really this way. And have any of you had an opportunity to be inside of water, like, totally immersed by water? Can you remember what that feels like? Have you ever been able to hear a sound inside of water? And I know there's a lot of sounds around us, but can you like, remember a little bit what that sound like? Do you experience that sound as a sound or as a feeling in this

# Unknown
# moment. And have you ever been able to see light inside of water? Could you close your eyes and see that? Isn't it amazing that you can see light when closing you out,

# Unknown
# makes me think about what light really is. So imagine that this was like a way, and in that way, there were several bodies of beings,

# Unknown
# not a body of being, but several bodies of beings. And the way that they were bodies of beings is they were bodies of beings together. They related together. And imagine that everything that you are comes from that way. Everything all parts of them, all parts of whatever you identify yourself as comes from that way, and in that way, there was an acceleration, like a significant moment of growth change. And there was, in that significant moment of growth and change, what we now call fear. It was an experience of fear. Something's happening too fast, something is changing too quickly us, as bodies of beings, do not yet have a relationship with what that is. And then that moment, we made a decision to create what we now call fundamental separation. So whatever that acceleration was, we used all of our bodies to take it and to separate. And this entire story comes from that moment, that first moment of separation, which we believed was something that we were doing for Phil feeling whatever word came to mind is a word that came to mind so downstream from that evidence, the memory of that first moment of separation, started to collect evidence that it happened. Could not remember what happened before it because it was separated, but remember that it was at least had that experience. So this way is a way that I'm calling harmonious 358, and it's really kind of an allegory. And inside of the story, there's a couple of things I want to ask you to consider suspending judgment around or maybe the way you currently believe. For example, this is a real question. What do you define as love? Smart? How would you define love? Let's it's easier.

# Unknown
# How would you define? Hey?

# Unknown
# Maybe another way of entering this conversation would be in all of our bodies. Is probably a really, really, really difficult memory, something you personally experience,

# Unknown
# that you prefer to not experience again. So if you have the ability to recall that, imagine a body that experienced that over several generations, what that body might be like,

# Unknown
# how that body might show up, not one, not two generations, but several generations, a body that has been conditioned to experience that over and over and over and over and over again, and imagine that little bit of whatever you feel in your body is what's been happening for generations. It's been there, what that might feel like, what behaviors that might create. And the good news is, is that there's also other kinds of memories in the body. You know, there is the they're part of this very much. You even take that. What does that generate?

# Unknown
# And imagine your body too. There is a really good moment. You have a moment, something that you would love to experience over and over again. You would have no resistance, as Rha’s taught us about, you know, there would be no resistance to experience. Experiencing that over and over and over and over and over again for generations. Could you imagine that? You imagine a body and what the body would be like if it had experienced that over generations?

# Unknown
# So imagine that that's actually what's happening is, I guess, what I'm asking you to do, just imagine that that's how the body actually works, and that whatever experience you've experienced in this lifetime is not an experience that you've experienced in this lifetime alone, and that everybody is an opportunity to experience that differently. Thank other things to ask you to consider. Is when I asked you about the definition of love and I asked you the definition of my hate, some of these memories might have come up. So now I asked you, with those two things in your consciousness, how you define love? How do you define love? Sorry, how

# Unknown
# you define hate. So inside the story harmonious, there are a bunch of characters who are navigating this discussion, and one of these characters is the character named Gideon. And Gideon is the kind of character who takes 42nd street as their practice ground. Gideon is a character who has memorized what it's like to walk through 42nd street and never have to stop. Understands every movement of a shoulder, every movement of a bag, is tracking all the energy and can handle all of the movement, all of the energy, without ever needing to stop. This is Gideons practice to be in movement without ever having to stop. And Gideons job is actually as a merges, as acquisitions. Oh, was, help me fill in a word. There you go. Gideon job is to broker the merging of bodies, whether they were institutions or nation states that you would typically imagine do not belong together, and Gideon has gotten very, very skillful at doing this. So question, an active question that I gotta invite some contribution to, what is an organization that you would say is, hands down, a model organization. This organization is something that should exist into the future generations. Continue that body, those bodies of beings, that organization should persist across the generations. You have an organization in mind, Montana, Girls Who Code. So imagine Girls Who Code persists into generations, because the body that is those bodies of beings have been not only deemed as worthy of persisting into generations, but did so hold that thought for me, and what's an organization that you feel emphatically should not persist into the generations. Those bodies of beings. So imagine Gideon was the kind of person who could merge project 2025 and Girls Who Code,

# Unknown
# and in that merger and acquisition, they would be a new body of being.

# Unknown
# Yeah, imagine all the bodies that was actually in Project 2025. Still existed in that body. They weren't discarded, they weren't retired. Still a district, but because they were in a root body with other bodies of being, they could body differently. Gideon was masterful at this kind of negotiation, and Gideons playground was 40 seconds, because in this place, there were all these bodies that represented, these bodies that some of us believe should persist, and these bodies that some of us believe should not. That's why he practiced here. And there were other characters. And one of the things we learned from Gideon is Gideon is Gideon was really interested in renegotiating words. For example, I asked you right now, what is the root word of the word harmonious? And you all will say, harmony. What's the root word of harmonious Harmony? Harmony? What's the root word of harmonious harmony? What's the root word of harmonious. In harmonious, the root word of harmonious was harmonious because there was no distinction between the way and the root harmony in harmonious was an instance of harmonious. So whenever we experienced harmony, we were experiencing harmonious. So the relationship with the root was different. And so Gideon realized that if they could remember language differently. They can re engineer a lot. What is the root word of joyous?

# Unknown
# So imagine if all of us had the ability to adapt as quickly as you just did. Gideon was fascinated with that. How can we create an environment where the root word of joyous is joyous, not joy, because the root and the way is the same? But Gideon also understood that they needed to drive in capitalism and in the marketplace, the economy and so didn't make judgments about what we were just felt this pull to continue to facilitate these mergers between these organizations that historically would not be together. And where did Gideon get this behavior from? Gideon was collected by someone named sagacious. Now, sagacious is actually not even someone. Sagacious is not even a being. Sagacious is a remembrance. And sagacious is the name for the remembrance of the first moment of separation. So sagacious has been around for as long as our experience of separation. And sagacious collected Gideon in an effort to remember, because Gideon has access to something that sagacious does not, which is within their DNA, evidence of harmonious and there are tons of other characters, like Nubia, who reminds us that while there are remembrances of the first moment of separation, there are also remembrances of the moment Before separation, that moment right before where it was like we have a way, and if this happens, we will have another way. And in the great moment of compassion did not stop it could happen, but did not, because Nubia trusted that the way was the way, and never lost connection between that moment and what we now know as separation. They're out here too. She's out here too, trying to collect us so that we can fundamentally remember. So I go back to these memories that I asked you to climb there for a moment, these really difficult moments, these really high moments, and imagine that Gideon is in a coma because Gideon is walking on 42nd street. Gideon is on their phone. They're negotiating a deal, and I don't know who the who the director or the board is for Project 2025, but do you do any of you know who the names are? Are they people we can name? We don't know how to name them. Let's imagine Gideon knows their name vote, and let's imagine that Gideon is on the phone with them. However they identify him, great him on the phone with him and understands it has to speak just below the register, just below where Russell can hear, because it would force a higher level of presence in Russell just below the register. And it's in this conversation and about to make the deal happen, where Russell accepts enthusiastically this murder. Can you imagine it? Can you imagine a place, a way where Russell enthusiastically, not begrudgingly, but enthusiastically, Gideons got there, and a being, an energy, a remembrance, enters into 42nd street and sagacious, and Gideon freezes for the first time in years. And then that moment of freeze gets hit by a bus and goes into an a coma. And in that a coma is having this dream not unlike the dream you're talking about. And let me tell you why it's similar. When Laurie talked about the dream that Laurie imagined, could you all like imagine? Did it spark some imagery in your mind? I remember Lori said something about the skin. Can you tell me about that again?

# Unknown
# Can you say that again? Flora and Fauna experience such a harmonious state? Can you imagine that?

# Unknown
# Can you imagine it better if you close your it. So just imagine that, and imagine that, whatever you imagine is for you. Now,

# Unknown
# there's a couple more things I want to tell you, but it's important for me to stop and just give you home for free. You and so encouraged to say whatever's coming up for you and listen to the story is exactly what's supposed to be coming up for you and listening to the story. Because the truth is, I'm not trying to convince or get you anywhere. I'm just trying to share a context and a framework for you to remember what's uniquely yours.

# Unknown
# So with that said, Gideon is having this dream. And in this dream, what Gideon is experiencing is what seems like a struggle between two bodies of beings. It seems like a struggle. And the way it feels like a struggle for Gideon and Gideon consciousness is that there are these bodies that are fighting. They are striking, they are harming, they are hurting, they are trying to destroy. Remember earlier when you were imagining those bodies and what the body from that experience might be? Imagine that they look like that. I'm not going to describe what those bodies look like. I'm just going to say, imagine those bodies are like the bodies you imagine would result from generations of that experience that you said in your own body you do not want to experience again.

# Unknown
# Gideon is watching Gideon is also watching other bodies of beings who have very different behaviors, and imagine that those bodies are like the bodies that you were imagine. Can

# Unknown
# you imagine that now what I'm gonna do for the first time in the story, is inject something that's my body, my memory, because there is a way that I'm really interested in all bodies having access to it, and that way is, is the way we fight. And so what Gideon is experiencing is a way of fighting where instead of strike and strike back, and instead of strike and evade, they strike in constant touch, constant touch, constant touch of the body looking for that one part of the body that still remembers that is not one to fight. So imagine if these bodies are being so I lovingly call the love. That's how they adjust bodies. That's how they struggle with bodies. It's a beautiful, benevolent struggle, but it's one of constant touch, looking for searching for feeling, for that part of the body that can remind itself that it does not okay. You wanted me to buy wood. And one of the things Gideon remembers in that moment is this the first moment in Gideons life where Gideon feels absolute peace while Gideon is witnessing the struggle. Gideon is not in struggle.

# Unknown
# So Gideon makes up out of the sacoma after all of that life of training. And this is where the actual story begins. This is the sort of, I guess, hero's journey of harmonious and the rest of the story of which I want to tell you soon more of begets on these couple of definitions. So when I asked you what your definition of love was, I allowed for a moment where you thought about it and decided whether you wanted to share it or not. One of the things that I want to offer is, what if a definition of love was at least two choices to remain connected when separation was available?

# Unknown
# Imagine if that was like a functional reserve definition what might be possible for us. Imagine if in our genetic DNA was all of the memory we needed. And imagine if no AI could ever see it. Imagine if it just was unavailable to be read, it could only be experienced. So that

# Unknown
# feels like a good place for me to stop today, because this story, and this like way of telling this story, and this opportunity to look into the work of all the people who have to shape me, including Raphael, because you probably can hear so much of RA in This story, is something I like to really contribute to the world, and I think it's totally doable that we could experience ourselves in those ways.

# Unknown
# Alright? Each

# Unknown
# other. So what if? What if that was what we could do? What if there was a what if there was a way with which this remembrance of a moment before separation was vibrational and light like axiom waves light and sound in the same way we learned that's true. And what if, in this generation, we found ways to adjust our bodies such that we could live with that energy? Let's say, for example, for this, for the sake of being convenient, that there were some meteor showers in the universe coming to earth, and we thought, we really, genuinely thought it was going to be a world level extension event. All the things that Peter and other people have taught us about is what we're imagining will happen. And let's imagine right before it happened. Once it hit the atmosphere, it transferred into energy, and it just energetically adjusted us, and now we had an opportunity to live with our fear differently. No, that's what I'm really curious about in a story like this. What if that's already available to us, like rod keeps telling

# Unknown
# it is, and what

# Unknown
# if a story like this could make it more interesting for people to believe that it already is? That it

# Unknown
# already is. So, yeah, that's

# Unknown
# probably a good place for me to again, invite you into your own experience of harmonious

# Unknown
# at least two choices To remain connected in separation as well.

# Unknown
# Two choices Yes, and sometimes it's relational, just with yourself. So I'm not suggesting that it has to be my choice and your choice. It can just be my choice and my choice. I'm also not suggesting that we remain in environments that are harmful. I'm saying we remain connected to what allows us to experience harmonious if we separate from that first, it becomes much more difficult to separate from. So that's why I just felt into and asked for guidance. What is the words? What are the words that will allow us to see the root of harmonious as harmonious, not as harmonious? And I imagine it feels to me, it seems like all the different ways of trying to describe what my what our guidance is telling me is that it's at least two choices to be made, connected With Separation.

# Unknown
# You

# Unknown
# About I my hope is, if we don't have to work anymore, we can just do things like spend quality time with other bodies. I go

# Unknown
# back to round this table. I

# Unknown
# when we did this question,

# Unknown
# church. Of course, I'm committed to living here and something

# Unknown
# that is very Hard to COVID.

# Unknown
# Energy, you for

# Unknown
# your transmissions, right? You?

# Unknown
# Occupied territory to get to routers out and what we experienced traveling through,

# Unknown
# and then what it brought, international,

# Unknown
# and then what your brother and what was your Honor to just ground and

# Unknown
# have a Love of God.

# Unknown
# Behalf of that I

# Unknown
# continues

# Unknown
# To our joy. We live into it. Tell me actually. It.

# Unknown
# The remix of it as a state you you spoke it at some

# Unknown
# stage. Cool thing about my relationships with the young people in my life, I'm only saying that in respect to Peter, I never have a hard time sharing my lineage with people. I feel proud to have lineage. I feel proud to be a part of you.

# Unknown
# Definitely,

# Unknown
# so yeah, may the root word of joyous be joyous. May the

# Unknown
# root word of harmonious be harmonious. And

# Unknown
# so it is, so it is, so it

# Unknown
# is. Through us.

# Unknown
# After Okay,

# Unknown
# I may be here at 5am. This is so interesting. I'm not wanting to vote.
